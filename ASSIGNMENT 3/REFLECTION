I am finding myself thinking back on the information and thoughts that were provided during Miss Qistina's industrial discussion. Miss
Qistina's in-depth discussion of numerous aspects of system development, including the challenges encountered and unique solutions implemented,
has increased my spirit and knowledge about this field. Furthermore, listening about the speaker's experiences and industry methods has motivated
me to investigate and go deeper into specific aspects of system development. This talk not only improved my understanding but also ignited my
enthusiasm for this field. Moving forward, I am inspired to apply the advice and tips that given by Miss Qistina into my academic and professional
endeavors, continually seeking opportunities to learn and grow within the dynamic arena of system development.
