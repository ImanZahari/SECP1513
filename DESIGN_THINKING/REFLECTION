Embarking on the journey of Design Thinking has been truly eye-opening. It encouraged me to approach problem-solving with a fresh outlook, emphasizing
the significance of empathy in understanding the needs and challenges of end-users. The ideation phases have become a canvas for creativity, fostering
an environment where even the most unconventional ideas are welcomed. Prototyping and testing have instilled in me the valuable lesson of embracing
failures as stepping stones to success. Through the iterative process of refining designs based on feedback, I've not only improved my solutions but
also cultivated a resilient mindset. Collaborating with diverse perspectives has enhanced my appreciation for the collective and dynamic nature of each
project. Reflecting on this experience, Design Thinking has equipped me not just with a methodology but also with a mindset that positively influence my
approach to addressing challenges in both personal and professional aspects of life.
