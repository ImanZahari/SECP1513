After attending Dr. Seahâ€™s Technobizz webinar on technology-driven technology industry, my
understanding of the symbiotic relationship between technology and agriculture has significantly
deepened. Dr. Seah's ability to seamlessly connect technical concepts learned in the classroom to their
real-world application in agriculture was eye-opening. This talk debunks the stereotype that technology
is only associated with complex advanced computing, prompting a reassessment of its potential impact
on an important aspect of our daily lives: the source of our food. I was impressed by the realization that
technology can be a powerful tool for social good. I am now motivated to explore how technology can
be creatively integrated to enhance the way we live our daily lives and make a positive contribution to
improving our communities
