For me, this talk is greatly motivating in my journey as a computer science student. To know that there is always time and room for improvement,
and that there is a community where students like us can publish our work and get constructive criticism makes me want to start big projects. 
Furthermore, the reminder that we can all serve to learn from our mistakes will make me try to step out of my comfort zone and go further
and beyond.
